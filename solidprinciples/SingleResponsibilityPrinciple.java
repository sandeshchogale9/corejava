//Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should focus on a single responsibility.
//
//When to Use?
//When a class is handling multiple unrelated functionalities.
//To improve code maintainability and readability.
//To avoid large, monolithic classes that are hard to modify.

    //‚ùå Problem: The class is handling two responsibilities: salary calculation and report generation.


    //After Fixed
