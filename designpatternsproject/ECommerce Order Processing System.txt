Project: E-Commerce Order Processing System
We will design an Order Processing System that uses various GOF Design Patterns to handle:
✔ Order creation (Factory, Singleton, Builder)
✔ Payment processing (Strategy, Adapter)
✔ Notifications (Observer)
✔ Logging and security (Proxy, Decorator)

Tech Stack
🔹 Java 17
🔹 Spring Boot (optional)
🔹 Design Patterns (GOF)
🔹 JUnit (Testing)
🔹 Lombok (Simplify boilerplate code)

Step 1: Create Order Processing System Architecture
Design Patterns Used
✅ Factory Pattern → Create different types of orders (Regular, Express)
✅ Singleton Pattern → Ensure only one instance of OrderService
✅ Builder Pattern → Construct complex Order objects
✅ Strategy Pattern → Payment processing strategies (CreditCard, PayPal)
✅ Observer Pattern → Notify users via Email/SMS
✅ Proxy Pattern → Secure access to OrderService
✅ Decorator Pattern → Add logging functionality dynamically

Step 2: Implement the Design Patterns
1️⃣ Factory Pattern - Order Factory
2️⃣ Singleton Pattern - Order Service
3️⃣ Builder Pattern - Construct Order Objects
4️⃣ Strategy Pattern - Payment Processing
5️⃣ Observer Pattern - Notify Users via Email/SMS

 Next Steps
🔹 Add More Design Patterns (Decorator, Proxy, Adapter, etc.)
🔹 Convert to Spring Boot Microservice
🔹 Add Database (MySQL, JPA)
🔹 Create REST API (Spring Boot Controllers)
🔹 Secure with JWT and Spring Security

Summary
✔ Factory Pattern → Create different types of orders
✔ Singleton Pattern → Ensure only one instance of OrderService
✔ Builder Pattern → Construct complex Order objects
✔ Strategy Pattern → Payment processing methods
✔ Observer Pattern → Notify users about order updates
