//Bill Pugh Singleton (Best Practice)
//When to Use?
//When you want lazy initialization, thread safety, and performance efficiency.

//Pros:
//Lazy initialization (Instance is created only when first accessed).
//Thread-safe without synchronization overhead.
//Cons: Noneâ€”this is the best Singleton implementation in most cases
