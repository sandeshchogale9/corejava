//DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
//Definition: Avoid code duplication by reusing logic through functions, classes, or modules.
//Extract reusable logic instead of repeating code.
//Helps reduce bugs, improve maintainability, and make changes easier.
//
//When to Use?
//When you notice duplicate code across multiple places.
//When you need to centralize business logic to avoid inconsistencies.
//Helps in avoiding redundancy and improving scalability.

    //‚ùå Bad Practice (Violates DRY)

    //Good Practice (DRY Applied)
